## About The Project


The main purpouse of the project is to gather information from every trashcan in a cheap and efficient way.

Here's why:
* Trash recollection mismanagment is an issue that affects everybody in the city but we believe it can be fixed with data! 
* Mismanaged garbage generates floods, traffic and possible health problems.

Gathering information is just a part of the project. In the future we would like to analyze the data in order to desing better,healthier and more efficient cities

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
